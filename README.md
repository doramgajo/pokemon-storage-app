Pokémon Storage is a shared Pokémon storage system. It allows you to have your own pokémon, view other users' pokémon, search and sort the database.

It was built in Kotlin using Android Studio and Google Firebase database.

> [!NOTE]  
This app was developed during my time as a student, under a tight deadline and while managing other projects. It offers the core functionality, but you may encounter bugs, rough edges, and code that’s not production-ready.
